# Mixtape
An app that lets anyone become a songwriter.

## Overview

Everyone, no matter their musical training, has come up with a song. From silly, childish, rhymes, to angsty love songs, to impromptu rap, to parody, and much more, we all have a song to sing. But unless you're a highly trained songwriter, it's incredibly difficult to take the melody in your head and turn it into a real song with full accompaniment.

Mixtape's goal is to let everyone join in the fun of creating music. We train a machine learning algorithm on popular combinations of melody and chord progressions so that it can listen to a user's own song, and construct a complimentary accompaniment track. All you have to do is open the website, put together a quick melody using our intuitive musical staff and notation page, and then Mixtape takes care of the rest!

Mixtape is a collaboration by the E1 Technical Group's founding members: Lisa Fu, Anthony Mayfield, Nikhil Prabala, and Trevor Tsue.
