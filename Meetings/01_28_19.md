## How To Handle Chords

We discussed inversions and normalizing chords and melody to a single octave prior to training and for inputs. 


## Communicating Input

The Input should be a JSON file sent to the backend.

## Machine Learning


Maybe only one LSTM? Trevor did some math here and drew a diagram, I'm sure he can explain it to you lmao.


## Discretizing Features 

What should our smallest unit of time be? Base them on the BPM of the input melody, which is currently pegged to 120. Then we can say that each quarter note
is half a second of data. Our smallest unit of time will be a 16th note, which is 1/32 of a second. This allows BPM to vary because that just changes 
how long each note is, but the ratio between the notes stays the same.  


## Discussed Frontend

Look for relevant image file to see how we structured our frontend framework for the melody input GUI.
