# Local Server Instructions

This folder contains files needed to run an Angular JS based Node JS server that uses express. Some assembly required.

## Installations

You need to make sure that you have Node JS configured on your system along with the package manager npm. If you have them already, great! 
If not, then be sure to use the links below.

https://nodejs.org/en/

https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

Afterwards, be sure to navigate to this folder (JS_frontend) on your local machine and install angular and express. 

``` 
    npm install express
    npm install angular
    
```


To run the server, type in `node server.js`.

Afterwards, navigate to localhost:3000, and you should be served a page with other links. Use the browser inspector to debug and navigate any error messages.
